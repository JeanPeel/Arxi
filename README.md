# Arxi Paints

This is a webpage built to be an online portfolio for my daughter and her artwork.  My daughter picked the colors and contributed to the layout ideas.  She also made her logo.

## About this project

This project includes a portfolio of Arxi Paints current Art Wrok.  It also has older Galleries of Ari's Artwork during Highschool.  This page also has an About Me Page where Ari gives an introduction about herself and shows some pictures.

## Tech Used
* Bootstrap
* Google Fonts
* CSS

## Details of App and Challenges
I used percentages to define the sizes of items in the CSS file.  But the layout of the page is not showing well in all sizes.  I will want to do some media calls in the future to improve the general flexibality of the page and responsivness.

The Galleries only work if there is one of them on a page.  The page with several Galleries does not have Galleries working correctly.  In the future I would like to find another oiption to show all the artwork on the page.
